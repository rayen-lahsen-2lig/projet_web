        Hello everyone me it's Benji 
        <br> I'm 6 months old 
        <br> I like hugs, walks and play with dog friends and I hate boredom.
        <br>
        I get along well with cool females and males
        <br>
        If you like hugs and have time for long regular walks and a dog friend in your entourage or the possibility of meeting them often to play I am ready to join your family</p>
