        Hi! my name is suzie i am just 2 years old
                <br>
                i was born in two colors orange and white
                 <br>
               I am very calm and  friendly 
               <br> 
               I have a lot of love to give for the people who give me importance
               <br>
               I went through a bad experience on the streets
                <br> bad humans hit me for no reason
                <br> I slept hungry, cold, hurt
                <br> i just need some love, attention and a home.
                <br>
                So if you adopt me i will always be faithful and grateful
                <br>
                </p>
